Timesheet system notes

Preffered development ideas:
Development improvements:
1) The initial intent was to use a light weight sql db as part of the in-memory aspect with 
	*Entity framework
	*Repository design pattern -> where I would have created the ef operations and handled the db objects.
2) Dependency injection by adding a scopped to the middleware and inject the functioanlity to the controller
3) Stored procedures which would handle the CRUD aoperations 
4) An interactive/ reactive webpage where if things were changed the page wouldn't need to refresh
Testing
1) I would have like to have used moq, and implement a more detailed TTD workflow.
